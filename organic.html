                <h2>Organic Coffee</h2>
                <p>Coffee is among the most heavily chemically treated foods in the world. With organic coffee, there
                    are no synthetic fertilizers or chemicals used in growing or production. Organic coffee beans are
                    richer in healthful antioxidants, and many people can even taste the difference.</p>

            <p><b>Help and participate in a healthy ecosystem</b></p>
            <p>Organic agriculture can strengthen the natrual environment's resistance to disease</p>
            <p>Coffee is among the most heavily chemically treated foods in the world. It is steeped in synthetic
                fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides – a real mouthful with a
                bad taste. Not only does the environment suffer from this overload, but so do the people who live in it.
            </p>
            <p>In the case of organic coffee, there are no synthetic fertilizers or chemicals used in growing or
                production, which means cleaner beans, air, land, and water. The coffee is grown with only organic
                fertilizers, like coffee pulp, chicken manure, or compost. Organic farms also combat climate change by
                emitting less carbon than chemical farms, while also sequestering significant amounts of carbon. As a
                bonus, organic coffee beans are richer in healthful antioxidants, and many people can even taste the
                difference. Your health, and the health of the planet, both get a boost.</p>
