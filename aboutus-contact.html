                <h3>About US</h3>
                <p>In 1997, our co-founders Tommy and Sara took a trip to Guatemala to discover the coffee beans.
                    The coffee industry was massive and they were shocked by the sheer number of coffee farmers living
                    below the poverty line.
                    Tommy and Sara wanted to get in to the industry and at the same time, make sure the farmers and
                    earth was well treated.
                    They believed there was a better, more equitable way to work with coffee farmers.</p>
                <p>They then later started their own coffee shop were their organic coffee was sold. Tommy and Sara has
                    now opened several shops in Norway, and continue to make sure that the farmers and the planet are
                    are well treated, by producing organic coffee. </p>
                <p>To make sure you get the freshest coffee out there, our Director of Coffee sources seasonally, our
                    roasts will change depending on the time of year</p>
